    <h1>We are outraged.</h1>

    <p>
        While we were sleeping, the world shifted in a dangerous and irreversible way—
        and most Americans were given no warning, no chance to debate, no choice.
    </p>

    <h2>What Happened</h2>

    <p>
        Donald Trump has bombed the capital of Venezuela, killed innocent civilians, and abducted its president.
        He now openly claims that the United States “runs” Venezuela and will take its oil.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is not foreign policy. It is conquest. And it all but guarantees corruption and profiteering
        by Trump himself and his oligarch allies.
    </p>

    <h2>An Illegal Act of War</h2>

    <p>
        This attack was launched without Congressional authorization, without credible evidence, and in direct
        violation of the UN Charter and the post–World War II international order that has helped prevent global
        war for 80 years.
    </p>

    <p>
        It mirrors the very doctrine embraced by Putin and Xi: that powerful nations are entitled to
        “spheres of influence,” free to dominate weaker countries by force.
    </p>

    <p>
        Think it's OK because Maduro is a bad person? Think again. The worldview of "might makes right"
        is exactly what led to the first two world wars. What does this say about the possibility of a THIRD world war?
    </p>

    <h2>A Familiar and Dangerous Distraction</h2>

    <p>
        The administration’s claims about drug trafficking are a transparent lie. This reckless escalation appears
        designed to distract from the damning evidence emerging from the Epstein files — and it puts millions of lives at risk.
    </p>

    <p>
        History has a name for this tactic: <strong>"Wag the Dog"</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>Why You Should Care</h2>

    <p>
        So what does the situation in Venezuela have to do with us?
    </p>

    <p>
        We cannot allow a president to manufacture an illegal war, seize another nation’s resources, and drag the world toward
        catastrophe, just to save himself politically.
    </p>

    <p>
        If this is allowed to stand, no constitutional limit on executive power remains meaningful — including here at home.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Action Matters</h2>

    <p>
        Silence is complicity. Democracy requires resistance.
    </p>

    <p>
        Call your U.S. Representative and both Senators today and demand that Congress:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Condemn this illegal act of war;</li>
        <li>Reassert its sole authority to declare war; and,</li>
        <li>Block any further military escalation against Venezuela.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Congress must act — and they will only do so if we force the issue.
    </p>

    <h2>Sample Call Script</h2>

    <p>
        Here's a sample script you can read verbatim to the person who picks up the phone, or leave as a voice mail.
        You could also copy it into an email, modifying it as you see fit.
    </p>

    <p>
        Hello, my name is [Your Name], and I’m a constituent from [City / ZIP].<br>
        I’m calling to demand that [Representative/Senator _______ ] publicly oppose President Trump’s illegal war against Venezuela.
    </p>

    <p>
        Bombing Caracas, abducting Venezuela’s president, and claiming the U.S. now “runs” the country and will take its oil
        violates the Constitution, the UN Charter, and international law. Congress — not the president — has the sole power
        to declare war.
    </p>

    <p>
        This reckless escalation risks global conflict and appears designed to distract from Trump’s personal legal and political troubles.
    </p>

    <p>
        I expect [Rep/Senator ___] to condemn this action, reassert Congress’s war powers, and block any further military escalation.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you.</p>

    <p>[Your Name]</p>
